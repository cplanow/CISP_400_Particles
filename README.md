# CISP_400_Particles By Ali Chenari and Chris Planow

A particle system simulation implemented in C++ using SFML graphics library. The project demonstrates matrix transformations and particle physics in a visually engaging way.

## Features

- Real-time particle system simulation
- Interactive particle creation with mouse clicks
- Matrix-based transformations (rotation, scaling, translation)
- Physics-based particle movement with gravity
- Color transitions and particle lifetime management
- Unit testing framework for matrix operations

## Prerequisites

- C++98 compatible compiler
- SFML 2.x library
- Make build system

## Building the Project

1. Ensure SFML is installed on your system
2. Clone the repository
3. Use the provided makefile to build
